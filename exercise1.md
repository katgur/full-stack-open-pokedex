* Common CI/CD steps for a python project is installing dependencies, linting, testing, packaging and deployment. There is no build step like in compiled languages as python is a interpreted language. But there is a similar step called packaging on which conversion into a format that is easy to distribute and install is happening. There are some common tools in python ecosystem like:
1. pip (the most popular), poetry and pipenv for dependency management.
2. ruff, pylint, flake8 and black for linting. 
Black is used for code formatting while flake8, pylint and ruff applies additional linting rules to the code according to the style guide. Ruff is considered to be way more faster than other linters.
3. unittest and pytest for testing.
Those tools usually work together as unittest is a part of a standart python library and pytest is compatible with unittest and has additional features.
4. Packaging is a step that can be different for a particular project. There tools like build and twine which allow to generate a distribution archive and upload it to the pip dependency manager. Also there is a tool like docker for making a container image. Anyway the result of this step is a deployable artifact.
* There are many alternatives to Jenkins and Github Action for building a CI/CD pipeline. In terms of remote services, there are many popular options like TravisCI, CodeShip, CircleCi and Semaphore. There is a service which can help in choosing the best option: https://www.g2.com/categories/continuous-integration.
* The choice between a self-hosted and cloud-based environments is depends on development needs like server resources, scalability, complexity. For a high complex development that requires a lot of server resources the better option is using self-hosted environment which is also more complicated to setup but brings more flexibility and control. For a more usual cases the cloud-bases solution is better as it takes control on boilerplate code. But it's not the best option for scalable projects as it has limited resources.
